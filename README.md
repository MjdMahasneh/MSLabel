# MSLabel

MSLabel for bounding box lebelling multi-spectral (multi-layer, and possibly time series) imagry.
This tool is useful when visual inspection of two bands, simultanously, is required to create labels.

```
Assumes dir tree as follows:
   images/band1/band_1_image_1.png, band_1_image_2.png, band_1_image_3.png, etc..
   images/band2/band_2_image_1.png, band_2_image_2.png, band_2_image_3.png, etc..
```
